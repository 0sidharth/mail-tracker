<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Email tracker is a webapp that maintains the status of a database of recipients whether they have received, seen or replied to emails you have sent them. You can customize your first email, reminder email and have them sent in regular intervals with minimal intervention.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">We are a team of four from IIT Bombay. Our main inspiration was to make something that we ourselves will be able to use and can also be modified easily to cater to anyone elseâ€™s requirements.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9">Apping ,as we call it, is a tedious process of mailing HR managers or professors to secure internships or jobs. It requires a lot of patience and perseverance to mail them everyday, keep track of replies, giving them reminders, etc.<br>
So the main aim is to somehow automate this task where the app keeps track of everything with just one click.</p>
